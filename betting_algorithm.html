        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
            This project utilizes a proprietary machine learning pipeline to predict UFC fight 
            outcomes and identify positive-expected-value (+EV) betting opportunities. 
            Moving beyond basic physical attributes, the model leverages advanced feature 
            engineering to quantify fighter durability, recovery curves, and psychological momentum.
        </p>

        <p> 
            By integrating historical betting odds with these domain-specific metrics, the 
            system detects when public perception (and market pricing) drifts away 
            from statistical reality. The algorithm specializes in identifying high-value 
            upset scenarios where a fighter's durability or stylistic matchup is 
            undervalued by the general market. In out-of-sample testing spanning from 2023 
            through late 2025, the model's "Underdog Hunter" strategy 
            identified 262 value bets. From a total hypothetical wager of $26,200, the 
            strategy yielded a net profit of over $18,600, representing an return
            of investment of approximately 71%.
        </p>
        </p>

        <h2>The Technical Challenge</h2>
        <p>
            The technical challenge of this project resided in quantifying relevant 
            domain-specific concepts like "chin health" and "ring rust" into vectorizable 
            features. Due to the proprietary nature of this feature engineering and 
            the algorithm's potential commercial application, the source code remains private.
            However, the repository can still be found below.

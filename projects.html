        <h2>Implementing Emotion Recognition in a Social Robot</h2>

        <p> We developed a computer vision pipeline using Python, OpenCV, 
            and DeepFace to enable real-time facial expression analysis 
            in the social robot Epi. We validated the system through 
            a controlled experiment comparing algorithmic outputs with 
            human observers, identifying both hardware constraints and 
            software limitations in the aforementioned HRI technology.</p> <a href="epi_project.html">Read full description</a>

        <h2>Reading Minds and Providing Feedback in Meditation</h2> 
        <p> A custom, real-time neurofeedback software was built from the ground up.
            Designed for the Muse 2 EEG 
            headband, the software analyzed alpha/theta ratios, translating biological 
            metrics into real-time feedback cues. This system was used to benchmark 
            embodied vs. audio guidance, ultimately testing whether a 
            robot's physical presence enhances or hinders meditative states. </p> <a href="cog_thesis_description.html">Read full description</a>

        <h2>Predictive Analytics for MMA Betting</h2>
        <p> Designed a machine learning system to predict UFC outcomes by quantifying 
            complex variables like fighter durability and recovery rates. 
            Moving beyond basic physical attributes, the algorithm leverages
            these inputs (including quantifiable features I engineered) to find high-value 
            bets where the market undervalues specific matchups. The model has 
            demonstrated significant predictive power, achieving a 71% ROI  
            (on underdogs) in backtesting.</p> <a href="betting_algorithm.html">Read full description</a>

        <h2>AI and the Risk of Cognitive Atrophy in Human Cognition</h2>
        <p> A collaborative philosophical inquiry on the ethical consequences of 
            integrating AI into human cognitive life. Drawing on frameworks like the 
            Free-Energy Principle, we argue that widespread reliance on AI for 
            'augmentation' rather than 'restoration' risks inducing cognitive atrophy,
            a gradual erosion of essential human 
            capacities such as autonomy, competence, and authentic connection.</p> <a href="AI_article.html">Read full description</a>

        <h2>Building This Website</h2>
        <p>A custom-coded portfolio built without external libraries using solely HTML/CSS.
            The website was built to be a distraction-free environment for long-form documentation.

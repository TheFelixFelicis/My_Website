        <h2>Article Overview</h2>
        <p>
            This project was a collaborative effort between myself, Marcus Lindelöf, Valery Nkenguruke. 
            In this collaborative work, we analyze how the integration of AI tools is reshaping the 
            structure of human cognition. We argue that while AI offers potential enhancement, 
            widespread reliance on generative AI systems risks inducing 'cognitive atrophy', a gradual 
            erosion of essential human capacities such as autonomy, competence, 
            and authentic interpersonal connection. We identify an important 
            distinction between using AI for 'restoration' versus 
            'augmentation', arguing that each of the two categories come with different sets of consequences. 
            The essay concludes with a framework for 'prudent discernment,' advocating for 
            technological designs that preserve human agency and the ability to find meaning.

        <h2>Brief Overview</h2>
        <p>
            This master's thesis sought to investigate the efficacy of neurofeedback in meditation 
            training by comparing an embodied social robot guide (Epi) against a 
            disembodied voice-only guide and a control condition. The thesis aimed to determine if physical 
            embodiment improves the attainment of meditative states compared to standard 
            audio feedback or no feedback at all. By analyzing electroencephalogram (EEG) 
            measures, specifically the alpha/theta ratio and its stability, alongside 
            self-reports, the work evaluated the impact of these different feedback 
            modalities on focused attention meditation.

        <h2>The Technical Challenge</h2>
        <p>
            The technical challenge of this project resided in creating a closed-loop system 
            capable of offering real-time preprocessed data on meditative states. This involved 
            developing experimental software to process live EEG signals, 
            specifically calculating the alpha/theta ratio and alpha/theta variance 
            semi-instantaneously, and translating these biological metrics into 
            dynamic feedback cues. A key component of this engineering was designing and 
            sequencing distinct humanoid movement patterns for the robot (Epi) to create
            an embodied effect that differentiated it from the audio-only condition. The system 
            required precise synchronization on multiple levels to ensure the 
            readings accurately reflected the user's current neural state during 
            the meditation sessions. The complete repository can be found below.

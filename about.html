    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <div class="container">
        <p> I'm a Data Scientist with a Master's degree in Data Science 
            (in progress), a Master's Degree in Cognitive Science and a 
            foundation in Philosophy and Psychology. I use this multidisciplinary 
            background to translate the ambiguity of real-world data into precise, 
            functioning systems.</p>

        <p>I've always had a curious mind, drawn to the big and interesting questions. 
            My voyage started in philosophy. At the time, it seemed like the most 
            reasonable path to embark on since that is where some of the most 
            foundational questions are addressed. The abstract and verbal intricacy 
            of the subject was fascinating, but after some time, I realised I wanted 
            to do more than what the philosophical method allowed for; I wanted to build.</p>

        <p>Cognitive Science became an optimal bridge, allowing me to take my passion 
            for complex systems and apply it. My master's program was my proving ground, 
            where I dove head-first into hands-on implementation. I didn't just study 
            perception; I built computer vision pipelines for social robotics, 
            engineered real-time signal processing systems for EEG data, and compared 
            spatiotemporal data in VR and motion capture.</p>

        <p>That hands-on experience was not only deeply rewarding, it solidified my path. 
            Data Science was the clear next step, allowing me to focus my passion for complex
            systems on building concrete solutions, whether that is training 
            classifiers to predict outcomes, segmenting datasets through clustering, 
            or analyzing sentiment in unstructured text. I like to view Data Science as
            applied epistemology.</p> 


        <p>In collective work, I'm known for being reliable and putting in the necessary effort, 
            no matter how tough the task might seem, but I firmly believe that 
            even the most serious work is done better with a calm, creative, 
            and kind attitude. The series of steps I have taken has taught me that 
            the goal is more than just building something technically sound; 
            it's about applying a reflective process to create solutions 
            that are thoughtful and valuable.</p>

        <h2>My Unique Approach</h2>
        <p>Philosophy is not a divergence from data science; it is a toolkit for it.
            It provides the frameworks necessary to navigate uncertainty, definition, and validity.
            Here is how I apply that toolkit to data:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Logic & Critical Thinking:</strong> I was formally trained in logic and 
                critical analysis. This allows me to dissect complex problems, question 
                assumptions in a dataset, and build models that are not just technically 
                correct but relevant and logically sound.</li>
            <li><strong>Ethics & Data Validity:</strong> My studies in Moral Philosophy and 
                Philosophy of Science give me a clear framework for problems such as AI 
                ethics and model bias. This enables me to treat these issues not as abstract 
                concerns, but as concrete problems of definition and data validity.</li>
            <li><strong>Clarity & Communication:</strong> Philosophy of Language teaches, 
                among other things, the understanding and elimination of ambiguity. 
                I apply these skills to explain technical findings to 
                non-technical stakeholders in a way that is clear, concise, and useful.</li>
        </ul>
